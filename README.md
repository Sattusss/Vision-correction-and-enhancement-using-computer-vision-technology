## Introduction

Vision correction and enhancement have significant implications in various fields, including healthcare, augmented reality, robotics, and more. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of computer vision techniques that can be applied to correct visual impairments, enhance image quality, and improve the overall visual experience.

By leveraging computer vision algorithms, it becomes possible to address issues such as blurry vision, low visibility, color blindness, and other visual anomalies. This repository covers both theoretical concepts and practical implementations of vision correction and enhancement methods.

## Features

- Vision enhancement techniques, including image denoising, contrast enhancement, and sharpening.
- Image deblurring algorithms to improve the sharpness of blurry images.
- Color correction methods to address color blindness or improve color perception.
- Visual impairment correction, such as techniques to aid individuals with low vision or visual impairments.
- Augmented reality-based vision correction and enhancement applications.
- Deep learning approaches for vision enhancement and correction.
- Interactive demonstrations and examples.
